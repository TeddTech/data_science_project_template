# data_science_project_template
This repository contains a basic cookie cutter template for data science projects.
By running this script you create a git repository with the following structure:

```
|-- CITATION
|-- README
|-- LICENSE
|-- data
|   --
|-- doc
|   --
|   --
|-- results
|   --
|   --
|   --
|-- src
|   --
|   --
|-- from_joe
|   --
|   --
|   --
```
-------
Create the cookie cutter template by running the bash script in the  following link:
![cookie_cutter.sh](https://github.com/TeddTech/data_science_project_template/blob/master/cookie_cutter.sh)

The following are the arguments the script takes in:
* `project_name` - The name of the project
* `first_name` - The first name of the author of the project
* `last_name` - The last name of the author of the project
* `year` - The year the project was last edited
* `license` - Full path of license file to be used
* `cit` - Full path to file containing any reference used

Usage Example: `bash cookie_cutter.sh project_name first_name last_name year license cit`
